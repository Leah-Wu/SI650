            "[['the company that sold me the ear buds was great!  the product is awesome...very little wind noise.  they keep the sound from escaping so you can enjoy the music and eliminate most of the outside noise.  i love them!  god bless!  joe'], [\"i've ordered 3 of these replacement packs for a couple of pair of shure earphones over the last couple of years.the sound isolation from the foam is excellent, they are fairly easy to use, and fall out less easily than any other option i've tried.  probably only custom-fit molding works much better.the passive sound isolation is better than active noise cancellation by manufacturers such as bose, as numerous studies have shown.  i'm always amused by the bose-users on airplanes who don't realize they would get better sound from tiny earphones like shure or etymotic than their 5lb monsters with batteries.only two minor caveats, one of which should be temporary - (1)  there are no shure earphones with the button for an iphone yet, only an adaptor, this must be fixed soon.  (2) it takes a bit of force and finesse to put the new foams on the earpieces, i haven't had trouble but some might.[added 1/13/08 - just tried the new black foams, see my review, not quite as secure, same sonics, better looks, more expensive]\"], [\"first off, i love my new shure e3c phones! i can really hear the music and none of the annoying chatter when i'm flying anywhere. the ear foams were my best choice as i have small canals. a 20-piece set of spares is a good buy, as your originals will eventually get too dirty.\"], [\"i'm not a musician and i've had shure headphones for a long time.  they are the best and most effective noise canceling headphones due to the foam earpieces.  they came very quickly and work wonderfully.\"], [\"if you've been looking around for foams for your westone, shure, atrio or other comply 100 in ear monitor or earbud than look no further.  i highly prefer these to complys as i believe they provide a better seal and for me are at least as comfortable.  the isolation is just as good as well and because they are memory foam you really don't need the &#34;tapered&#34; quality that the shure's have.i have also found that these last a little bit longer in that if one side gets dirty or messed up you can just turn it around since they are symmetrical on both ends.highly recommended, i always use these with my westone's.\"], ['when i bought this item, i was looking to replace my original ipod earbuds, which had finally started breaking down after about a year.  i received these and was impressed at the range of sound they delivered.  however, after around three months (which just happens to be the exchange guarantee period, oddly enough), the earphone i was depending on (i am only allowed to use one at work) began to fade out after a few hours of listening.  i had to literally stop listening after a few hours just to let it \"recharge\" enough to get a good volume again.  i just bought a new set of earphones at walmart for half the price to replace these.  i\\'m betting a brand name like philips will be better quality than this product.it\\'s good while it lasts, but don\\'t use it for any actual \"sports\".  i will never trust this brand again.'], [\"let me start by saying that these are extremely light and comfortable, i have worn them 'pain-free' for hours, and the sound quality is very good.  now for the down side: i see that these come with a zippered case now, which i did not get when i purchased these last year.  maybe this will alleviate the problem with the rubber ear cups easily falling off.  i have lost 5 out of the 6 that came with the earbuds, and now i can't wear them any more.  also, one of the wires pulled out a little from one side, but it still works.  i will either have to try to find replacement cups for these, or i will buy a different brand of ear buds to try.  why is it so difficult to find a decent pair of earbuds?!\"], [\"i did the whole burn in thing and these still didn't sound as good as the 10 dollar over the ear kind.  i tried all the different ear connections and none of them fit right and i could never get a good seal so maybe that's why the sound was lousy.\"], [\"these sound squared earphones feel as if they aren't even there, that's how great these things are!  the ability to size the small, cone-style earbuds with one of the (sm-med-lg) rubber dams provided means that the buds themselves simply lay against the ear canal, suspended from the over-the-ear hangars that are soft and flexible.  if you never felt the cord move against your jawline, you would forget you have these in.  i recommend them to anyone interested in excellent sound quality and comfort with the critical bonus of the buds themselves staying put!\"], ['the earphones that came with my mp3 kept falling out.  i use the mp3 for my long mike rides, and am not able to fool with them.  these are fabulous.  they fit securely on/in my ears.  they are comfortable.  and they produce terrific sound.  i recommend them highly.'], ['i\\'ve tried at least 6 different sets of wrap around and \"sport\" earbuds for the gym and so far, these are the only ones that have managed to keep themselves in my ears and actually feel secure and snug.the part that wraps around the ear is actually much smaller than any other earbuds and i think this is why they work so well.  i tried the wrap around neon green sennheisers, a couple of the sony sport earbuds (the ones with the kidney bean shaped ear wrap are pretty good but still got a little loose) and a couple of others by phillips and what not.these are very comfortable and though they require a hair more effort to actually get around the ear, once they\\'re there, they are snug, comfortable and the rubber tip on the end of the earbud that goes into the ear is quite comfortable.they do a great job of blocking out sound once they\\'re in and music is going.  it\\'s quality sound blocking as well.. not the \"sticking your head underwater where everything is muffled\" type of sound blocking.as far as the actual audio quality goes, they fall a bit short of the sony\\'s and sennhesiers.  they\\'re a hair less crisp and filling in the lower midrange.  various eq settings on the ipod though can compensate for this to a degree but at the end of the day, it\\'s what keeps these from getting a 5 star rating from me.for 9 out of 10 users though, it\\'s fine.  i\\'m an audiophile stickler when it comes to things like that but honestly, for the money, it\\'s really good.  i use the sennheiser ew 300\\'s when i perform on stage but there\\'s no way i\\'d bring a $900 pair of earbuds to the gym.despite marginally inferior sound quality from these, they\\'re the ones i use simply becuase of the comfort and quality of fit and to me that\\'s just as important as the audio quality... i mean.. what\\'s the point of having great audio if they either don\\'t stay in your ears or constantly slip around or fall off?i know eventually they\\'ll either get broken from my own carelessness or accident or something so i got a 2nd pair.'], [\"i've used these headphones for over a month now and i like them more and more. i have small ear canals and the different size ear fittings definitely help. the sound is very detailed and the bass is natural and not overpowering. you really need to try the different fittings to get the best fit in your ear. if they're too lose, you'll lose bass and detail. i'm pretty satisfied for the money spent. i can't imagine any headphones being that much better without spending a lot more money. these are definitely keepers. give them a long try.wgh\"], [\"i bought these thinking they were a great deal even if they only lasted 1 year.  boy was i wrong.  they only lasted 3-4 weeks.  they function fine if you baby them.  i do not as i use my iphone everywhere (home, gym, work, car, etc).  i killed my original iphone headphones by stepping on them one too many times.  right side still works, left is dead.  they made it about 1.5 years.  i avoid bluetooth as i don't know the long term effects of use...so i use these headphones constantly.  these new ones worked fine for a short period of time(the call button/next track/pause feature needed to be pressed pretty firmly, but worked).  the problem is that the plastic/rubber that connects the cord to the plug (metal end of the headphones) broke in half within weeks.  soon, the left earbud stopped emitting sound.  i was forced to pay $30 for a new apple branded one at best buy....you pay for what you get.  be warned!!!\"], [\"these were purchased as a replacement to a lost pair. work great and look so similar to the originals that my teen doesn't mind they aren't iphone\"], ['ok s s s s s s s

touch.we will see how they fare over the winter.'], ['yes these apple headsets could be better. but at least you know what you are getting. if you have an iphone or ipod then you know what the apple headphones are like. and they are way better than the knock-offs. you are not gonna find a better pair that is iphone compatible for under $100'], ['i have purchased a total of 3 sets of these in a little over a year. these are the perfect solution for the problem i have with the apple earbuds, which have a tendancy to fall out of my ears, and don\\'t fit my ears properly.i was using the size 6, because with other products i have needed to use the largest size i could find, but i found out by accident i can use the included size 5, which is much more comfortable.when on a trip from california to texas, i forgot my accustibuds, and i discovered the plane engines were so loudthat i could not properly hear my audio books. so i orderd a set of accusitbuds when i got to my sister\\'s house to use on the trip back.another reason i like these, is that i get to use the volume and pause feature of the ipod/iphone earbuds, which i have not found on any earbud replacements.the main thing is to find the size that fits comfortably. ear canal size is different for everyone, and i am 6\\'2\", and i find the size 5 to work withou bothering my ears.ron m.,southern caalso, i find street noise greatly reduced when using them.as with all products, follow the instructions! (and yes, there are instructions! simple, easy to follow, but follow them!)these guys are ready and willing to help with any issues.'], ['i have been searching for earbuds that would fit my small ears for years. i figured these would work because they\\'re \"tapered\" and come in 2 sizes. well, they didn\\'t fit. neither size would stay in my ear. save yourself the trouble and pay $6 more for the jbuds. they fit!!!'], [\"i hate apple headphones!!! let's get that right up front. i have very tiny, child-like ears and no ammount of pulling, shoving, twisting, and squeeking in pain will make those monstrosities comfortable in my ears. however, these adapters are really quite good. they look huge when you put them on the headphones, but when you stick them in your ears they are soft, squishy, and delightfully comfortable. they even help with the crappy sound quality of apple headphones. a very good idea and a good product.\"], [\"i have trouble with ear buds- they don't stay in my ears.  but these fix that problem.  they don't really enhance the sound or block out ambient noise, but they help the buds for my bb stay in, and are much more comfortable.\"], [\"they just don't seem very comfortable.  i don't use them.\"], ['i purchased this item to attach it on my blueant z9i. at first, i was attracted to it because of the unique design and how it was advertised to stay tight in the position.although i used the smaller size (size 5), it was difficult to squeeze into my ear. within 10 min, i realized that the earbud was compressing my ear too much. i was hoping that this pain would go away as i get used to it. after 2 hours, i had to take it away and used my original earphone. this product is only good if you could stand with the pain in your ear. i would not recommend people to buy this item.'], [\"who knew it was possible to make ipod earbuds even worse? i'm afraid they've succeeded. for the first time ever, i've found an earbud product that fails to fit, requiring that i either mash it painfully deep into my ear canal or it simply falls out. the sound isolation properties, therefore, are mute (little joke there, get it?).as far as sound, if i hold them in my ear they do enhance the clarity of the earbuds' output. unfortunately, this just clarifies the miserable quality of apple's earbuds. they sound better when you can't hear their sound as well. [kind of like hip-hop in that respect.] while this lousy sound quality is obviously not the fault of the adapters, it makes more sense to put the few dollars you'd spend on these toward even a cheap pair of earbuds. find yourself a tiny pair that will fit nearly anyone, are small, lightweight, and less obtrusive/uncomfortable, that stay in your ear with ease, and that sound better than the pair included with your apple product.there are some real crap earbuds out there, but find a pair priced over $50 on sale for half off and you've got yourself a much better sound than is possible from apple earbuds, no matter the adapter. as apple's earbuds are priced higher than that at retail and truly require some kind of adapter in order to stay put and reduce background noise at all, and since i haven't seen any earbuds other than apple's that these would fit, i have to say that these are worse than useless.one last comment: several years ago, these and the similar ones available (which i've also found disappointing), made much more sense. quality sound in an earbud was hard to come by and was very expensive. adapters allowed for some refinement of what was affordable (free). now, though, they are no longer a viable product category, imo.\"], [\"i'm not sure if it's the shape of my ears or if earbuds are just poorly shaped but, either way, i have always hated wearing them.  they're fine for a short while but then they become painful.  as soon as i decided to buy my zune, i knew i had to get some other type of headphones to wear as i was sure i wouldn't be able to tolerate the buds for any length of time.  after looking at various types of headphones and balking at the cost (i was already coughing up enough for the zune itself), i decided to give these adapters a try.i think they are a fantastic product.  it was easy to get them over the earbuds and i was pleased that they came in two sizes.  i find them much, much more comfortable than the buds are without them and can wear the buds for much longer than i would be able to without the adapters.  the shape of them also helps funnel the sound much better so that i usually only have to set my volume to 1 to be able to hear my zune perfectly.  in fact, sometimes the setting of 1 even seems a little too loud.  i was really happy about this as well because i've read about hearing loss due to mp3 devices and was a bit worried i'd have to really crank my zune to cut out any background noise.  i highly recommend these as a much more economical alternative to buying a whole new set of headphones.\"], [\"i have a big head an big ears and this doesn't fit me, they are also a bit hard to get on the phones. i hoped to use this for a motorcycle application, but i dont think its gonna happen.\"], ['these were slightly tricky to fit to the earbuds, but once in place they work well. they definitely enhance the sound quality, even more than i anticipated.  they also reduce a lot of external noise. this was a great purchase!'], [\"works just as i hoped: it holds the bud in the ear comfortably and snugly and helps keep perspiration from getting into the earpiece. i cannot agree that it improves the sound of the buds, though. the bass is enhanced, though it becomes a bit boomy. if you're getting these to work out with, they are ideal. i wear them for running and they serve well.\"], ['these do not do what is advertised.  the sound is much worse when wearing them and neither size fit into my (normal sized) ears so they fell out.  i am returning them.'], ['these devices to a good job of keeping the apple earbuds lodged in your ear canal. unfortunately, they also muffle treble response and decrease overall sound quality.'], [\"wasted 10$.i thought they'd be something like the earbuds ibeats (by monster) uses, but no no. these are completely useless. wouldn't recommend, there are better sets of headphones at this price than the earbuds.\"], ['these work great, they enhance the base and sound so well (by blocking outside noise)that i am able to listen to my music with the volume half of what i do with ear buds by themselves. i definitely recommend these.'], [\"these ear bud replacement covers are everything they claimed to be. however, they take some getting used to. if you've never had in-ear headphones with this kind of ribbed projection, you may suspect (as i did at first) that they are too large...way too large.my advice is to screw them in. this method has worked well for me after my initial assessment that i must have abnormally small ear canals. these things are huge! after giving the acoustibuds a second chance i found, as many previous reviewers have stated, that they will stay snugly in the ear during any normal activity.the sound is truly enhanced over what was possible from the original iphone ear buds. all things considered, i'm very pleased with my purchase.the only thing that keeps me from giving the full 5 stars is the price. even considering customary mark-up and factoring in the rules of supply and demand, $10 still seem like a lot to pay for a set of 4 tiny pieces of rubber that couldn't cost more that $0.03 to

stated, they are simply too big for my ears too.  i'm using them right now; however there is a considerable amount of discomfort due to the process of forcing them into the ear channels and the pressure they are exerting.  i agree with other reviewers that they should make them smaller so that they are easier to put into one's ears without pain.  had i read the other reviews i probably would have saved $9.99 plus shipping.  i do intend to give them further use to see if they get better, but i am disappointed that i purchased them without looking for something else or reading the reviews first.  another point...the manufacturer, acoustibuds.com, makes a box with three sets (including a 4,5,and 6).update:i tried the 4 model, which was sent to me free of charge by the company after expressing my concern regarding size.  the #4 are a vast improvement in size over the 5 and 6 and may work for some of the buyers.  they were still a bit large for my ear canals.\"], ['i have tried several other noise isolation type of earbuds adapters (both add-ons and built onto the earbud)and these are the most comfortable i have used.  the great thing about them is the ease of attaching and

tell that the acoustibuds are a superior product.i gave the acoustibuds a 4 star rating because i really wish they had one size smaller. i must have an odd-shaped ear canal and after wearing the acoustibuds for an extended period, my ears get sore. as for my sound quality rating of 4 stars, this is to no fault of the acoustibuds. there is just so much you can do for the poor quality sound produced by the standard apple earbuds and the acoustibuds improve that sound as much as possible. if you\\'re looking for audiophile quality sound, i believe you should be in the market for new

given week i'll be working out, running, biking, on a plane, and sitting around with some `bud' or other stuck in my ear.  the standard earbuds that come from apple and you can get cheaply everywhere just don't cut it in my opinion - they aren't the right size, they move around or fall out, and tend to trap bubbles of sweat in your ear canal when they do stay in if you're working out.so i was very interested when i heard about acoustibuds - if it would be possible have a low-cost way of improving the standard  bud setup i'd be all for it!  these attachments are definitely an improvement on your basic buds, and while i can't whole-heartedly endorse them for everyone, i think they are a particularly good solution for a specific user; particularly anyone who is not satisfied with the earphones included in the new apple shuffle, which basically force you to use their buds.so what are these things anyways?  simply, they are small, grooved rubber cones with the large end just big enough to slip over the round end of your bud, and the small end positioned to pump sound into your ear canal.  they are easy to install and use, but make sure you get the right size (mine were a little too big, which made them a touch uncomfortable).  once attached, pull your earlobe and push these gently down into your ear canal, twisting a little to get good placement.  after some experimentation and adaptation, i found them surprisingly comfortable.  the sound quality with the caps was noticeably improved as well - perhaps due to the fact that less of the audio was being lost to the ambient air with the loose fit a standard bud gives.i did however have some difficulty with the buds staying in place.  that may have been because my ear canal is a bit smaller than most, but getting them positioned properly seemed to be a little hit or miss, and it was really frustrating if after all of that someone would come along and want to talk to me, or i jostled them in just the wrong way and had to pull them out and start over again.  to be fair, it was still an improvement over your standard buds, and this is probably just a good warning about getting the right size again!  i got a 6, but think a size 5 would have been more comfortable.bottom line - if you have a new ishuffle and don't want to pay $50 - $100 to get an adapter or other way of breaking the bud habit, these acoustibuds a great solution.  if you've got a bunch of buds hanging around, or want to quickly adjust (and make sanitary) the ones you use on a plane, these are great .  if you're looking for something specifically for jogging or something, you may want to pay a bit more for one of the headsets designed specifically for exercising.techtalk.wrlr.fm\"], ['it looks good on paper but just

only the 2 sizes - #5 and #6. #5 works, but #6 is simply too big, so i can't use it. it would be advisable for the mfr to sell a set that includes just one size for those of us who have determined the correct one. they sell a 3 pack that includes #4. i'd buy the pack of the just #4's in heartbeat. for me, the #4 is just abt perfect - easy to get into my ear, doesn't have to be wiggled and twisted

consistently high reviews on this product and wonder if it its really as good as all that (high sound quality, noise canceling, do they really stay in, etc). i have only had these for a short while, but i will be as detailed as possible based off my experience so far.i am using these with ipod earphones. they do make them sound a lot better, and they definitely stay in your ears, no matter how you move your head. you can even tug on the earphones (a bit) and they stay in. however...if you\\'re anything close to an audiophile, i.e. you like incredible sound, these don\\'t increase sound quality to that point. i have tried various eq settings on my ipod touch (maybe the most satisfactory being the \"loudness\" or \"hip hop\" setting for bass and sound quality), and these still basically sound like earphones...very good earphones, but earphones nonetheless. they don\\'t really compete with even headphones like neckbands from companies such as sony, etc, and so on if you like bass and high-quality sound. this is not revolutionary in that aspect. but they do make earphones sound better and do seem to add some bass. volume is also not an issue--your mp3 player is probably at least as loud as before with these.and they also do a decent job of knocking out noise from the outside. i doubt you could go on a very noisy subway with many people near you talking and the sound of the train and these totally cancel those sounds out, unless you play the music at the top of the volume. i can turn the tv up to a volume i watch it with my fan on and still hear the tv distantly. and you definitely can\\'t sit with just the earphones on with no music and block out noise. but you don\\'t have to turn things around you nearly all the way down with these.perhaps the one area where these buds really do stand out is how they fit on earphones and remain in your ear. they are very snug but not uncomfortable. you don\\'t have to keep pushing them in your ears like you do even with earphones that do kind of fit your ears, i.e. the philips virtual surround sound buds i have. i haven\\'t tried to exercise with these in yet, but i have no doubt they would stay in. this is, by far, the best thing about these earbuds. second best thing is how they don\\'t seem to leak what you\\'re listening to anywhere near the same degree as earbuds and headphones normally do, even if you\\'re playing something pretty loud. third is how they come in tiny ziplock-like bags, so you can use those to take them with you or to put them up when you\\'re not using them...which makes it easy to keep up with them, keep them from getting on dirty surfaces, etc.bottom line: if the main reason you\\'re looking to buy these is struggling with traditional earbuds staying in your ears, you should definitely get these. if you\\'re very serious about great sound quality/bass, i\\'d stick with headphones. as someone who is somewhat particular about how great phones sound, i would use these on the go, at work/when i just want to have \"background\" music playing, working out and things like that, but not when i really want to sit and hear music at its best. for noise canceling, i\\'d say it depends on how much noise you\\'re trying to cancel out. maybe for normal noise levels, these are just fine.--i have now tried these with the zune earphones, and i like these even better with those than with ipod earphones, particularly with the itouch eq on \"r&b.;\" the sound has a bit more clarity.'], [\"maybe i'm terribly picky, but i'd really hoped that these would be a few millimeters

sound quality & no more ear ache from long duration use. it's a well engineered product. you have to work it to fit your ear, so it stays long, firm & comfortable. it's the difference between wearing a sweat pants with elastic waist verses a dress pants with a belt, one has to work the dress pants, make it fit then put your belt on. i guess lazy people like sweat pants, just pull it up & go. if

these, it\\'s not supposed to go all the way into your ear canal (seriously, who does that?  if you were expecting to fully insert it, you may end up with a medical problem!!!).i just want to commend burton with this technology.  i can see why this \"little\" add-on has won several awards.  i just find it funny when people asks me \"you seriously think the default apple earphone sounds good?\"  i

simply remarkably soft comfort.  they\\'ve never hinted at falling out.  if you exercise intently with any kind of earpieces you\\'ve experienced perspiration working its way into your ear or around the headset.  it\\'s especially annoying with any \"in the ear\" piece.  the acuostibuds block the perspiration from the inner ear.  nice unexpected benefit.they don\\'t shield any appreciable noise. as a point of reference, i have some low end in-ear shure\\'s that i use on airplanes, and they do block noise.  and i have some radius atomic bass that are also \"in-ear\" and block noise well.  for exercise applications it\\'s better not to block the outside world.  but they do seem to well...\"channel\" the sound.  with the acoustibuds i can turn the sound down to a significantly lower setting.i bought the acoustibuds because i have a drawer full of earbuds that came with devices and thought perhaps this would salvage a few of them. acoustic quality isn\\'t much of an issue when you\\'re running.for me, the primary application is exercise or someplace where you\\'re moving around'], [\"well, did i waste money? yes and no. when i can get the buds to stick at the right angle in my ears, they work. buyer beware, though. getting them in and not falling out is a pia. the larger pair is useless so you will be stuck with 1 pair that might be helpful.why did i get these in the first place? one of the rubber covers broke off a pair of one of my fave earbuds so i thought these looked decent to replace the cover...and increase the base at the same time. well, i actually am not using these for that pair because the don't stay on, and am actually using it for an old apple earbud for which there is much improved sound when i can get them to stay.true product review is 2.5 stars and they should make them in white to match white earbuds...doh! i am still in the period to return if i want, so at the price i paid may seem to illogical to return as long as they improve the sound of one pair of headphones and they somewhat stay in my ears. good luck if you get them :)\"], ['excellent. great quality. blocks outside sound very well. reasonably comfortable. they come in two

stock headphones provided by apple, but they are always falling out of my ears. i didn't want to spend a fistful of money on another set of headphones - i jus wanted these ones to stay in my ear!the acoustibuds do the job. they wrap over the ear buds so there's no contraption to hang over your hear or stick out of your head. the ripple design helps them stay in the ear, even while exercising.\"], ['overall, i am happy with the sound quality of this earphone.  unfortunately, i have difficulty making proper fit.  the medium size earbud is just a little too big so i have to push it in every few minutes.  the small size is well, too small for proper fit.  the large size, forget it.had i been able to make proper fit i would give four star instead of three.'], [\"i loved the sound on these - great on the low end - but there was too much echo / interference from the wire for me. it was driving me crazy just walking so i can't imagine what these are like for running (which is what i wanted

disappointing bass response, not a good fitsome reviewers of these 'phones tell you to ditch your ipod earphones when you crack open the package and use a third party supplier. i've actually always thought that the earphones that come with apple's ipods are pretty good. but, darn it, they're flimsy and the cords do not appreciate being zippered up in a jacket, stepped on or lost for months in a jacket pocket!i appreciate an eclectic collection of music as much as anyone else. i can easily listen to gustav holst's the planets at 9am, crank up dave brubeck at lunch, then settle in for some joe bonamassa or old rolling stones hits in the late afternoon. but i don't spend more than $30 bucks for earphones. ever. i love music but do not appreciate the difference in earphone quality while listening to 320 bit mp3 recordings. maybe you do, so my review may not be meaningful to you.so my overall score on these altec backbeat earphones is a c++. i like their construction, because i tend to beat up earphones quite a bit. but their overall sound quality to me is not very high. the bass response on most music - from classical to rock - is wimpy. i agree with another reviewer that their mid- and high tones is good, but the bass is not strong enough to sound balanced.i can crank up the bass using the equalizer on my ipod, but even then, i have to jam the earphones into my ears to really appreciate a sufficient bass response.the other issue i have with the altecs is that they don't fit well. the earpieces that come with them are goldilocks-style... there are three sets of earpieces to accommodate most small, medium and large ears. unfortunately, none of them provide a comfortable or secure fit for me. the cords on these earphones are heavier than the flimsy cords on most other earphones, so the extra load causes the actual business end of these to come loose with the slightest motion. even sitting still on an airplane means constant re-insertion of the plugs into my ears. after a half hour, it becomes really annoying.so, while these earphones are well made and should last a long time, they don't work for me. their sound is good for the highs and mid-tones, but the bass response is inadequate for most of the music i listen to. the fit on these isn't right for me and these two flaws make them just a backup set of earphones i tuck in my backpack.\"], ['these earphones fit ok with the obligatory 3 sizes of pads included. however they don\\'t render bass well, and they induce a fair amount of noise/crackling compared to other earphones. i would suggest the \"klipsch image s4 in-ear enhanced bass noise-isolating headphones\" which are much better in terms of sound and not much more expensive.'], [\"if you don't get a good fit, they will sound awful, but

and lows, a bit weak in the midrange, but not so bad.\"], [\"i bought these to replace my old headphones that sucked. these were by far the best headphones that i have ever heard. i have many friends that are musicians and these headphones are comparable to those of in ear monitors that professional musicians use. the only problem that i had with them is that the woven cord amplifies the sound of the cord rubbing on something when you are listening to them, but if you have the volume set right you don't really notice.\"], [\"i have a pair of shure 110's which i used for comparisons purposes

expect them to as even my much more expensive shure's don't block out all noise.  if you want to block out noise get noise cancelling headphones.that being said these headphones are excellent.  bass was surprisingly deep and crisp.  highs were loud without being tinny.  i was listening to high quality mp3 files (256k) and the sound was superb.  equal to the shure headphones.  i really liked the length of the cord and the fact that the cord was not made out of rubber.  i would say these are the best earbuds you can buy at this price point.  i have listened to and owned many other in this price range and these are the best i have heard.overall this product rated 5 stars when comparing to other similarly priced earbuds.  sure $300 bose headphones may sound better but to get my 5 star

have a major flaw!what makes them flawed:their cloth-braided cords - with the lack of over the ear malleability in the cords. this is a feature of the 336 model and the plastic wrapped cords on the 336 seem to transmit less \"rubbing\" noise to the ear when the user is moving around. the amount of noise transferred through the cords on the 326 compared to other models is just excessive.sound production:the quality of sound that comes through these ear buds is just amazingly good. if you can stand to sit still and not move at all you will get an unbelievable experience with the music you play. only downfall of this is that if you download low quality music you will be able to tell how bad anything less than 192k bit rate really is.....all in all the sound is amazing but the interference is just ridiculous, even when compared to like style headphones. it\\'s nearly off-putting to even use the set with the level of this problem.'], [\"headphones are a personal thing. one person's amazing set of ear buds is another's torture device.  so i'll give you a quick bit of information about my music background and needs list, then how these stack up.i started working as a recording engineer and producer in the 80's and worked in studios for almost two decades.  i value neutrality and balance in either headphones or speakers.  i listen to all types of music, from jazz to rock, singer/songwriter to alternative, punk to funk.  i've never found a set of ear buds i love, but really that's a function of what technology can do; i don't think it's possible to get some that sound consistently as good as, say akg 240's or sennheiser 580's (both big, old style, closed-ear design headphones).that said, most people don't walk around with that kind of headphones on, and most portable devices can't drive them efficiently anyway.  but then, life is about compromise, so most people choose one of two types of ear buds:  the kind that sit in your ear like stock ipod headphones, or the type that seal in your ear canal, providing additional bass but also isolating you from external sounds (um, you might not want to jog at night, in the street, with that kind).  the altec lansing uhp326's are in the latter category.  so how do i like them?the first thing that struck me was that it was really tough to see which was right and which was left.  they are marked, but with a black l or r on black plastic.  in the dark, or even dim light, that's not good.  they really should have put a colored dot on one or the other. they do come with four different sets of plastic covers to fit various size ears; very important because getting a poor seal will give you really awful sound, with no bass or lower midrange.but once i got them fitted, and in the correct ears, i was relatively happy.  the sound at the bottom end is full and accurate (assuming a good, tight seal), though i found the upper mids a bit harsh.  high end is clean.they do have one problem that also affects the zune premium headphones: rubbing the headphone cord against your shirt, or in your hands, transmits that rubbing noise to the headphones themselves - it can be intrusive at times, particularly if you are listening to quiet classical music and moving around a lot.  however, this only happens when you make firm contact with the section of the cable between where the right/left cable split occurs and your ears.  the cable from the split to the music device does not transmit noise - a definite plus over the zune premiums.so overall, i'd normally give them three stars or three and a half stars.  at suggested list price (does anyone pay that, anywhere?), i wouldn't personally buy them.  but at the 30 bucks amazon.com is currently charging for them, i think it'd be hard to find a better set of isolation-type, hence a final four star rating.\"], [\"i've been looking for a pair of headphones that is both comfortable and sturdy.  most importantly, i need something to fit into my ears.  almost all ear buds that i've tried won't fit into my ears.  i've tried 5 different types of ear buds and still nothing.  i read the review on this one, and saw that there is a rubber tip, so i thought it will squeeze to fit into my ears.  i was wrong.  it still doesn't fit.  it falls out when i make the slightest movement.  not sure if it was defective or i must have freakishly small ears.  needless to say, i'm gonna return it.\"], ['let me start by saying that i\\'m not one of those \"audio geeks,\" that can notice tiny differences between different types of headphones.  that being said, these headphones do produce noticeably better sound quality than the ones bundled with most mp3 players (including the ipod headphones, zune headphones, and zune premium headphones).  as far as i can tell, these are similar quality to the more expensive apple in ear headphones.unlike most headphones, the \"wire\" connection the audio source to the headphone is cloth rather than a plastic coated wire.  it\\'s like a very thin shoelace, and does actually seem to be easier to untangle (therefore the \"tangle free\" advertisement).  i should note that these headphones get noticeably louder than any other\\'s i\\'ve ever used before, but this is probably not a good thing.  use caution when using them so you don\\'t damage your ear.  i can\\'t see any reason why you would need to turn the volume on your mp3 player to over 50%, except maybe for a quiet podcast.overall, these headphones provide the best bang for the buck of any headphones i\\'ve ever seen, and i would say that i highly recommend them if you\\'re looking to upgrade from the standard headphones that came with your zune or ipod without breaking the bank.'], [\"the sound is very trebly and thin.  i think they are very fatiguing to listen to even for a short amount of time at a little higher volume level.  there's no mid-range or bass.  just awful.  in they're defense though we tried some sennheiser's in the same price range and they don't sound any better.  the buds that came with my wife's iriver a few years ago sound much better.  we returned these.\"], ['the altec lansing uhp326 backbeat series in ear headphone with ultimate ears technology are a good pair of earphone/earbuds for a very reasonable price.let me start with the elephant in the room...the cable has a tendency to transmit noise along its length into your ear.the cable has a durable woven cover and this may very well be the source of much of the noise you hear noise. however i have many other woven covers that do not have this problem.the issue here seems to be an internal design of the bud itself not providing isolation from the cable.that being said, you can limit or eliminate the issue by wearing the earphone in the \"over the ear method\" and use the slider the provide a little tension which keeps the earbuds in place.by wearing them this way the tension along your jaw and around your ear will effectively dampen any sound transmitted along the cable.if that\\'s how you wear your earbuds these sound great. they feel like they have a good flat response across any volume. not too much bass and

but none are as bad as these. the cord is so sensitive, it\\'s like a stethoscope. with that negative aside, i found the sound quality excellent. they\\'re among the best i own, and definitely the

for several weeks in the gym.  there are a million unspeakable things that happen in a gym, things i would never mention in front of polite company, but one thing i have never learned to tolerate? gym music!  the first few times i tested these was with my favorite gym music -- queen, the who, ravi shankar, and miles davis.  i did have trouble with the quality of queen because occasionally i heard a tinny, brassy sound that was not in the original recording, but it was not too terrible.  listening tocomplete bitches brew sessionsis amazing; although at first it sounded like the sound was coming through a long corridor, but after this rough start, it was as full and beautiful as the original recordings.admittedly, i don't know much about sound quality, except when it reaches back to the part of the brain that stood a little too close to giant speakers at concerts in the 80s.  these headphones reach back and make the trek to loud and clear sound.these headphones do not eliminate background noise, but then they don't claim to eliminate it entirely and i'm not sure why people would ever want to completely eliminate noise... obviously people who have never been victims of sneak attacks by friends in the gym.the cloth cables are very nice too.  i was worried that they would catch on clothing more easily but they didn't.  that was a nice touch.the headphones are comfortable but they do not stay in.  i went through the variations of sizes but none are exactly right.  i'm not convinced that any in ear headphones will ever stay in through various activities like running and

pads and living with the result for a month. comply ear pads are standard equipment for more expensive headphones - and i can hear why. i had fit problems with the altec lansing ear pads. and if they don't fit well you just do not get good sound isolation or bass response. with the matching comply ear pads i get tremendous sound isolation and much better bass. it is just amazing - the improvement. you get 3 pairs of conforming ear inserts that are made to fit your model of headphone. they stay in very well and do not cause any pain or discomfort, unlike the altec lansing..now you can get the $99 backbeats for about $25. add $19 for 3 sets of complys. in addition, the headphone cable of the backbeat is much more durable. so you will be replacing the shure in about a year. if you get a little clip to prevent them from swinging around above your head when you are exercising then you will have no impact conducted noise - or you cound just get headphones with flimsier thin rubber that wont last.by the way, there are 2 different uph326 headphones on amazons website. pick the lower cost one.original review:i bought these headphones after seeing a recommendation consumers reports. they were ranked well ahead of the bose, which i own, and their price on amazon is so cheap i just had to try them.so i got them and started comparing them to the bose right away. at first i couldn't pinpoint the difference - then i realized that these have much clearer high frequencies. the background instrumentals are much less masked by the drums and vocals on these phones compared with the bose. i have had to play around with which earpiece fits best. the bose were much easier for me to fit into my ears. i have used the bose for over a year.if you loop the headphone wire over your ear before you insert the phones into your ear canal, and then pull the adjustable tension piece to make the cord behind your neck not too loose, you will have no trouble with rubbing sound on the nice cloth covered cords transferring to your earpieces. i also noticed that one of the rubber insert pieces seemed to eliminate all noise compared with the shorter pieces - i may not even have to bother with the advice i just gave with this insert. the insert one i am talking about is the one shaped more like a horn -with a wider piece that goes into your ear that extends away from the headphone.you really have to go to play with which insert is best for you. by the way - wet the rubber for a better fit into your ear.- altec lansing should have spent more time in explaining the process.\"], [\"i like to listen to several genres of music, so i wanted headphones with balanced qualities, not too much emphasis on bass or treble.  these fit the bill, and i can listen without bothering anyone around me who don't share my tastes.  the cord is a good length, neither too short nor too long, and it's sturdy.  this comes with a zippered carrying case and several sizes of earbuds.  it's pretty easy to pop the earbuds on and off to switch or to clean them.they are pretty comfortable.  if i have them placed to completely block outside sound, my ears get sore after about an hour.  the cord does conduct sound, just like if you put a pencil between your teeth and scratch it.  that's how sounds waves behave.  so i usually wear them by looping the cord over my ears, and pulling the earbuds just a teeny bit loose.  i still get good sound, and they're very comfortable this way.  since there isn't as much direct contact, it dampens conduction of sound through friction.  this works if you're sitting still.  they'll fall out of your ears if you're working out.  unless you have pretty tough ear canals, you'll want to pass on these if you want something for your workout.  but for chilling, they are just fine.\"], [\"to start, yes there is some interference with the cable rubbing which occurs with all in-ear headphones.  this one is just much more audible. however, the other side is the fact that these cables feel like they won't have any issues with shorts making them more durable.  i found that throwing your mp3 player under your shirt and leaving enough cable for the movement of your head will stop any interference, plus a mic clip would solve the issue.  also they have the adjustable length at the split so be sure to set that right.as for the rest of my review, the sound is great out of the box using the stock tips although slightly uncomfortable to me.  nevertheless, adding somecomply t-400 foam tips - 3 pair packopened these right up and made them sound like a pair that should cost around $300 not $20.  highs are crisp, bass is almost brain rattling at times, and that's only half way on my volume setting.whichever way i look at it, you cannot go

price.  the phones are made of plastic, mainly black except for gold-colored tips.  they don\\'t approach premium iems in build quality, but they are adequate for the price.  the cord is covered in a sturdy fabric, which i appreciate because it is not \"sticky\" like many current rubbery headphone cords.  the cords for the left and right ears are the same length, with a total cord length of about 45\".sound - if fitted properly (this is *essential* for any iem), the bass is deep; there is a bit of an emphasis on mid-bass, but not enough to be objectionable.  the midrange and treble are nicely balanced.  these iems don\\'t go quite as low as the denons or have highs as detailed as the ues, but again they do great for the price.fit - the altec lansing 326s come with four sets of neoprene tips (s, m, l, dual flange).  i was able to use the medium or large tips without problem.  altec lansing states that the dual flange tips can be used for extra noise reduction, but unfortunately i couldn\\'t get these to fit my ears properly.other stuff - the 326s come with a small zippered case to store your iems and extra tips.  microphonics are present as others have noted - but you can reduce the effect dramatically by looping the cord over your ear (see attached photo) or by using a clip to tie down the cord somewhere high on your shirt.  as for noise isolation, the 326s seems to reduce outside noise about as well as other iems with rubber / neoprene tips.conclusion - highly recommended, and a superb value in noise isolating iems.'], [\"i was blown away by the sound that was

one of the sweetest surprises in electronics. as a musician and consumer this product goes the distance.\"], [\"i have run through a number of expensive earbuds because of cord issues;  tangling adding to stresses that lead to shorts. i was recommended this model by cnet because of its cloth cords.i have noticed the difference - this headset is easier to untangle, and the earbuds have held up pretty well so far.  i do occasionally notice noise in the line while walking, as the cords rub against my shirt, but it's generally not an issue.  the stock earbud set is decent, but i prefer the foam style that shure offers.  the sound is decent for my needs; i listen mostly to podcasts and audiobooks at lower bitrates, so dynamic range isn't a priority for me.it's a solid backup headset, with the durability to endure activities i don't want to subject my pricier sets to.\"], ['pros: very good sound. crisp and detailed, especially on low end notes. the earphones do muff out a lot of ambient noise. strong and good length cables. good design (colors).cons: there were complaints about how when there is movement, the sound of the cable carries to the earphone. that is a perfectly legitimate complaint. i hear my music at ipod max levels and even when i am riding on the subway, i can hear the cable. kind of a downer because the sound quality on the earphones is quite nice. no backup rubber plugs. would much rather a wrap behind neck line instead of the traditional \"drape.\" easier to fall out of ear. not a very good travel earphone.overall: in you are sitting still, or using it on a computer, this earphone is perfectly fine. for the price, it offers phenomenal sound and quality; just don\\'t move.'], ['altec lansing uhp326 backbeat series in ear headphone with ultimate ears technologyfirst things first. ultimate ears is mentioned in the description but not on the packaging. i found that disturbing. i investigated further to find ultimate ears mentioned in the data sheet, apparently they supplied \"audio signatures and technology.\"  what that means, your guess is as good as mine. i own a set of ultimate ears headphones, super.fi 3, so my thought is to compare them. to be fair the super.fi 3 is more than  twice as much money, they better be better.the physical headphones are decent but the use of fabric covered cords transfers sound to your ears if they rub your body or clothes. this is quite annoying and is the biggest strike against them. if you sit still while listening, no problem there. the l & r markers on the buds are black on black molded into the plastic and are quite hard to see (to these getting old eyes).  i used the double flanged cover on the bud. they fit my ears well and stayed snug. they do a good job of isolating outside sound. the length of the cord is good even if you clip the player to your belt. the soft padded zippered carry case is more than fine and easily hold the phones and fit nicely and comfortably in a pants pocket.i used four styles of music and did back and forth testing of each headset. i used my iphone 3g as the player. i set the eq to flat and only adjusted the volume as the super.fi was much more efficient and played louder. the music i chose was from the albums; romanza by andrea bocelli, aja by steely dan, american idiot  by green day and some hearts by carrie underwood. a good mix of styles and sounds. i also listened to some talking on a podcast.money talks.  in each and every test the super.fi 3 sounded better. so if your budget allows go upwards in your choice of headphones. but, does that mean these altecs are no good to use, no. they\\'re ok and may fit your budget better. sound was good but i had some issues when listening to romanza.  sarah brightman on \"time to say goodbye\"  can really hit some high notes and the altec had trouble keeping up. i got distortion in her voice. i was able to compensate by playing with the eq settings.  in all cases with the different music, i felt the sound stage was constricted and vocal clarity was muffled a bit.overall these headphones are ok but not the best. they\\'re decent for the money and you may find them adequate.'], ['sounds great.  like the braid-wrapped cord.  but my ear canals are small and even with the smallest fittings, these things still hurt after an hour.'], ['i just received these and i\\'m very impressed right from the start. the comfort is very good, among the most comfortable i\\'ve tried among noise-isolating earphones. the ear cushions come in 3 sizes plus a dual-flange type that can create a nice, tight seal blocking out a lot of ambient noise. the feeling is like being in your own world just listening to music!the build quality is also very good as the cloth-woven wires are very sturdy and tangle-free. there is some \"interference noise\" from the wires while moving, but it\\'s not that bad as long as movement is kept to a minimum. because of this, i would not recommend these for any type of walking/jogging activity. the included soft case is a nice bonus.the sound quality is excellent for earphones in this price range. they\\'re good for all types of music. the sound spectrum is very balanced and natural - the treble and bass and everything in between blend in very well together with neither overpowering the other. side note: the audio source plays an important role as i listen to an ipod with music generally at the highest quality. lower quality music can be detected more easily with these.i originally compared these with sennheiser cx300 and ultimate ears metrofi 170\\'s which are comparable in price, and am glad i went with these. excellent value earphones with a sound much bigger than the price tag!6 months later...still sound great! the quality and durability are top-notch and for the money, an excellent value!'], [\"first off i am an audiophile so these are for the gym only. i currently use a pair of panasonic rp-hje300 ear buds which i like. i picked up the panasonic's for fifteen bucks. the altecs have more high end and they are crisper sounding on all types of music. the panasonic's are more comfortable to wear but i would have to say the altecs do sound better. i have smaller ears and the smallest tips are still a little uncomfortable but the sound is good. typical ear bud sound...highs and lows but not a lot going on in the mid range. these are not too bad though and for the twenty five dollars i paid i like them for the gym. if you have bigger ears and/or canals you might really like these. nice little pouch and the wire is covered with a fabric type covering.***update***after having these for a few weeks now i can say they sound pretty good but are uncomfortable. it's too bad because they do sound better than my old ear buds. i find myself constantly refitting them to my ears. also the other reviewers are correct the fabric covering on the wire introduces noise when it rubs on your clothing. again if you have bigger ears and\\\\or ear canals these might be right for you. sound is good for the money.4 stars for sound 3 for comfort\"], [\"i always like to remind people that speaker/headphone preference varies depending on personal taste. if you can find a friend's pair to listen to first, that's always a benefit when trying to find the right sound for you. i like several things about these headphones. they come with four sets of earpiece tips to give you the best fit. there is even a double-flanged earpiece tip to provide better sound isolation. the cloth cable cover is a nice quality touch. the headphones also come with a small, soft-sided case for easy, safe transport in a pocket. my only complaint with the design is that the stereo plug is the straight type that is more likely to put stress on the headphone jack. a 90 degree flush plug design would be an improvement.i found these headphones to be quite good for the price (mine were well under $30.00). several people mentioned the transmittance of noise down the cloth cable cover to the ears as a huge annoyance. i did not find this to be the case. listening at very low volume was about the only time that i noticed this issue. fit in the ear was comfortable. i preferred the double-flanged earpiece tips for maximum reduction of ambient noise. i listened to a wide variety of recordings and here are my impressions. the sound was very balanced. the response was even throughout the sound spectrum. i would describe it as warm, meaning that the highs were fairly detailed, yet not harsh and the mids and lows were free of booming or muddiness. the headphones handled heavy rock music, detailed jazz and acapella singing very well. midrange vocals were very full and clear also. these headphones represent an exceptional value, performing solidly across the sound spectrum at a price that is very affordable.\"], ['these were great headphones til one day after a run, i left them on the coffee table and the

audiophiles crazy people..the sound that i am getting out of these small earbud headphones is amazing. they produce a good range between the highs and lows. they do not completely block out noises

in my ears when exercising. it may have more to do with the sweat but i wish they would stay in.the headphones come with adddtional rubber earbuds, so they should fit most ears.i do recommend these headphones'], ['i am using these earphones with a portable dvd player and am basing my ratings for this usage.sound quality:  it has moderate background noise blocking and is adequate at the gym or on a commuter train.length: it is adequate.  at the gym, i use this during cardio (on a precor eliptical).  the length of the cord is barely sufficient to reach my ears comfortably.earbuds: this is the biggest problem.  the buds are too large for my ears, which are not small.  when using during cario, they fall out easily.durability:  the wires are wrapped with a woven cotton fabric which protects the wires from damage.  this is an a+.  but the earbuds have rubber tips which can come loose and no extras are included.  this is an f-.other:  this is not a plus or minus but a nice extra.  there is slider to keep the individual earbud wires together.  this makes storage nice, as you do not have two earbud wires flopping around when not in use.most people are going to use this with their ipod and will have different criteria to judge.  i do not have an ipod and therefore cannot judge suitability for ipod use.'], [\"i found these headphones to be of very good quality. i had never used any headphones, other than the ones that are ten bucks or less. so, this was my first experience with a pair in the higher price range. they fit well in the ear and it was nice that they included 3 different sized silicon earpieces so that you could get a good fit. they conform well in the ear and are comfortable to wear. for me, they fit so well that i didn't feel them in my ear after a few minutes. the sound quality was great. you can definitely hear more individual sounds with these headphones. the sound was just overall better than any of the other earphones that i have used before. the bass in them was unbelievable and everything else was crystal clear. they seem to be made well and pretty durable. i don't have any complaints, but as i said, i am no expert on these things.\"], [\"i got these headphones because my ipod ones went out on me after about a year. i was ecstatic for getting such an awesome deal on them. i only paid $18, awesome... right? well, sorta, not really.for starters, one thing that bugs me about the cloth covering the wires is that when it rubs against my jacket zipper, i here it as if through a stethoscope. ridiculous.second, the headphones don't respond well to aggressive movement. if the wire got moved a little too rigorously the sound in one ear would go in and out for a bit.third, they only lasted me like... 3-4 months. more on that in a bit.now for the good:1. because of the fabric cover, the headphones don't tangle as much, and if they do it's very easy to untangle them. that was a huge relief.2. another awesome thing as compared to white ipod headphones, they don't get dirty and nasty looking. i liked that.3. the sound quality is great. a bit quieter than my ipod headphones but i can just turn it up so it's not a big deal. there was no distortion and the bass is pretty nice.4. another huge thing is how comfortable they are. i put on the right gel things and they were great in my ear.there is obviously much more to these headphones but that's all based on personal preference and what not. the problem though is that after a few months my headphones crapped out. they still work, but i have to wiggle the wire and be super careful to make sure the sound is in both ears and not just in one. that get's really annoying. but here's the kicker, i take pretty good care of my headphones and ipod. i don't throw it around, i don't tug and pull at the wire or anything like that. so i would recommend you go for another pair. these aren't for the long haul.\"], ['for the price, the sound is phenomenal.  good base, clear mids and highs.  what more do you want?  some reviews have complained about the cloth cords causing excess noise, but i haven\\'t found this to be a problem.  it\\'s the nature of earbuds that they amplify any noise caused by rubbing the wires, and in my experience there\\'s no more noise from these cloth covered wires than from plastic wires.  the added bonus is that the these cloth wires don\\'t get tangled up in knots.  i can\\'t comment on the durability, but they seem pretty well made to me.  then again, they\\'re earbuds, so they\\'re going to be subjected to squishing, pulling, yanking, etc., on a regular basis.  for the price, they can\\'t be beat.  personally, i just can\\'t see spending any more money on earbuds to listen to music coming out of an ipod.  i know there are \"audiophile quality earbuds\" out there, but c\\'mon, \"audiophile earbuds\" is an oxymoron, because all you\\'re listening to is mp3 quality sound in the first place.  save your money, and buy some real headphones and a real stereo if you care that much about your music.  but for portability and casual listening on an ipod, these do the job exceptionally well.'], [\"i've had a pair of shure e2 for the last three years, and these are 100x more comfortable and sound much better, except when you move. as mentioned by other reviewers, anytime you move, the cloth cord rubs which you can hear. however, the price overcomes this major flaw. they sound great, feel good in my ear, and fit better than my $100 shures. if you're using them for stationary usage (i.e. sitting at your desk), they're perfect. if you plan to use them for working out, look elsewhere.\"], [\"purchased these earphones when looking at much more expensive sets based on a good review from cnet. sound is crisp and clear with outstanding range. wires are fabric covered which creates slight noise rubbing against clothing, so if you're moving around a lot while listening, these aren't for you and i would get an earphone with plastic coated wires instead. i'm usually seated and reading or using the computer when listening and i don't hear any wire noise at all. the good thing about the fabric coated wires is the slight stiffening that makes the wires more substantial and less subject to tangling when not in use. comes with a quality carrying case. outstanding value.\"], [\"this is the fifth pair of noise-isolating in-ear headphones i have owned, and by far the best! i have previously owned creative, jvc, woodees, and this particular time, i had a fight to the death between these headphones and

unbelievable. the high end is very polished, not too tinny. also, these headphones have what most cheaper headphones don't -- good mid-range! i usually enjoy my music using poweramp for android, and with my current equalization settings the clarity is stunning. and all for $30! the only complaint i have with these is the same thing everyone else says -- the rope-like cord transmits a lot of noise

the apple ear buds that came with my ipod.  in addition to the clean mids and highs they deliver, i am really surprised at how much bass these put out.  i've been listening to all sorts of music on my ipod including classical, jazz, pop and rock to name a few.  i've also listened to a few chapters of an audio book and everything has sounded great through these headphones.  they stay in place relatively well.  most 'normal volume' external sounds are effectively reduced but not fully sealed out, which has not been a problem. i have not yet noticed any extraneous sound transmission through the cord others have noted.  i found the 'l' and 'r' designations on each bud to be in a location that makes them  difficult to read.  however, i dabbed some red nail polish over the 'r' so now i can easily tell at a glance which bud goes into which ear.  these come with a padded, soft storage pouch which i have found to be very convenient. otherwise, the earphones and extra tips would be just laying around.the bottom line for me is that these iems are very comfortable with enjoyable sound quality.\"], [\"the altec lansing uhp326 headphones sound great overall.  the uhp326 headphones

choice of cylindrical or oval shape.  my preference was for the cone shaped plugs and it's nice that they were included.  many other headphones just come with different size plugs, but not different shapes.since the cord is covered in cloth, it tends not to tangle, but also tends to transfer noise to the ear buds when it rubs against clothes.  the cord is adjustable with a little tab that goes up and down.  i found that moving the tab up towards my chin greatly reduced the noise that was transferred from the cord hitting into my clothing.  the transference of noise from the cord rubbing against clothes to the ear buds is very noticeable and the reason i am giving the headphones 4 out of 5 stars as opposed to 5 out of 5.for audio geeks, the frequency response is 20hz - 20khz (-10db)

appears there is a flaw in the design and/or they use cheap materials.  now, i have to find all of the stuff that came with them, repackage everything, and go down to the post office again and wait up to 4 weeks for a refund.  please take my advice and try a different set especially considering the limited amount of time that you can return the item to amazon and then would have to get replacements

altec lansing uhp titanium backbeat earphones that are inexplicably listed twice on amazon (a dollar or two difference in price is the only difference between the two).  they\\'ve attracted a large number of negative, even hostile, reviews for two reasons: 1. the cloth cable conducts unwanted, extra-musical sound (\"microphonics\") when bumped and rubbed; 2. the most popular and respected consumer magazine rated them among the top 4-5 earphones, even though these altecs are a mere fraction of the price of the other members of this elite, high-end group.normally, i\\'m not a big fan of altec lansing products (never mistake them for james b. lansing, or jbl equipment, which is made by harmon industries; altec is a product of plantronics).  but i\\'d have to agree with the reviewers at the consumer magazine: the altec titanium backbeats hold their own with the best of them: the sound is full-bodied and full-frequencied, the sound stage is wide-ranging and impressive, approaching the quality of the better full-sized headphones.  it\\'s true that the cable will occasionally introduce scraping and bumping sounds, but only in response to the movements of the user.  i use them on a treadmill with no problems (perhaps by taking more than the usual amount of care not to jar the cable while walking).  because of the cable, i wouldn\\'t recommend them for listeners engaged in running or jogging while listening to music; otherwise, these are first-rate transducers.  (i wouldn\\'t be surprised if the cloth covering of the cable contributes to their sonic excellence: altec no doubt judged the positives to outweigh the negatives.)'], [\"the altec lansing uhp326 headphones earned a bonus point with me before i ever plugged them in.  just about the entire packaging is recyclable, unlike so many other consumer electronics products. the headphones include the pretty-much standard set of different sized silicone ear tips, including a double-flanged set.  i often have difficulty getting a good fit with any of this style of ear tip, and these were no exception, but i did manage to get the double-flanged set to work ok.  you need to make sure the headphones have a good seal in your ear canal otherwise you'll lose all the bass.  also included is a nice soft-side zipper case, but there is no airplane adapter (neither the double-plug version that i haven't seen in years, nor an inline volume attenuator which is often helpful.)the sound of the uhp326 was quite good.  a bit thin, i thought, but this might be due to the ear seal.  i've tried more expensive earphones that didn't sound as good. they did not easily fall out of my ears, but i admit i didn't try jogging with them.  the one problem i had was the cloth-covered cable that rustled audibly and annoyingly.  i should also note that these headphones offer little to no sound isolation.i noticed that the headphones had a mesh screen over the opening to prevent earwax from entering, so you should not need to clean them as often.\"], [\"i have a thing about putting things in my ears: i don't like to do it.  but i need to since i frequently do my surfing at night when the television is on and i'm sick of the dirty looks i get as i try to listen to a youtube video or a podcast.i'd only tried my iphone 3gs's earphones in recent history and i hated them.  altec lansing's offering has changed my tune -- and stopped the dirty looks.  while i still don't like things in my ears, these come with several sizes of ear buds and one fits very comfortably.  the sound quality is excellent (for my uses -- i can only speak for talk, not music).finally, the cloth covered-wires are great because my cat doesn't notice them and go into attack mode like he does with more obvious (and wiggly) plastic-coated ones.\"], ['i loved these headphones, they had a good bass and would block out outside noise. there are only a few small problems. the silicon earpieces would constantly fall off when i took them out of my pocket so be careful not to lose them. the other problem was the headphone jack. after a while i had to move around the jack so noise would come out of both headphones. as it turns out the wires were loose. so if you headphone is still under warranty get it fixed by altec'], ['the ue (ultimate ears) are by far better and they cost less and can be used w/ cell phones because they have the microphone, they are cheaper also, $25 here in amazon,ultimate ears metrofi 200v noise isolating earphones w/ microphonenoise isolating earphones w/ microphone.'], [\"these sound good - i'm older so my hearing is not what is once was - plus i'm using a iriver unit - iriver iy has the wow sound control so you can tune the sound to your ear buds which helps - they include different size ear plugs so you can get the ear buds to fit - the wires are covered with a woven cover - it may make them last longer - ear buds seem to break the wires inside at he ear piece or at the plug\"], [\"ok...i have been searching for several months for a pair of in ear headphones with audiophile quality sound that don't cost an arm and a leg!

never causing problems even when the iphone is in movement.... what i suspect is this: that the earphones are somehow becoming either disconnected, or that the earphones are sending a \"stop\" signal to the nano itself due to the movement. anyways, this is only an issue if you were planning to use these earphones with anything other than the iphone.'], [\"these headphones sound good. not great, but probably almost as good as ear buds could sound. the problem is the wimpy craftsmanship of the unit. i've actually worked through two sets of these and i won't be going back for a third.the first casualty was what the manufacturer claimed to be an extremely rare defect where the silver half of the bud came unglued from the black half. i didn't think they were separate pieces, but they are. the rep from the company was generous with his replacement, i got the exact same set for a 2nd go-round.my second pair has been genuinely frustrating. in a seemingly wise move, the unit comes with three sizes of rubber plugs to accommodate a variety of ear-hole sizes. this, though, makes it difficult to maintain. the rubber plugs constantly fall off in my pocket and now i lost one, so they're useless.overall, the craftsmanship is wimpy. the cord is really quite thin, and they definitely feel like they'll break because of this cost-saving measure before they break from listening to music too loud.given the quantity and severity of the issues i've had, i'm going to return them and just use the white plugs that came with my phone. while they sound way worse, i'd rather not have to re-assemble them every time i pull them out of my pocket.\"], ['i was pleased to find that these earphones produce base well beyond what i would have expected from such a small component.  the rest of the sound is pretty good too.i would recommend them to anyone that needs a new set of iphone earphones.the only thing i would add to these earphones is a clip and a case.  i reused the clip and case from my old earphones. i could see how not everyone would need/want these but if you do reuse one of your old ones.'], [\"sound is ok, price is right. however, five months in, half the cheap plastic cover for the pause switch is broken, and wires are exposed. i was never sure how that thing worked anyway. now i'll have to spend bigger bucks for the apple branded version as i have a lot of travel coming up.pretty annoying -

all ears are different!!!  try them all and use what works for you. if this style works best, use it!as a triple flange tip goes this tip has pros and cons.pros: the stem on this tip is longer than most tips which gives you the ability to push it deeper into the ear canal if you need to.  also, the stem opening is smaller than most so it fits much tighter on the earphone's stem making it less likely to come off the earphone and stay lodged in your ear when you try to take them out of your ears.cons: being a stiffer rubber than some of the other tips, it tends to have more of a 'memory' and starts to retain the shape of the ear canal fairly quickly.  over time, this memory prevents the tip from 'spreading out' and it therefore loses the sealing ability that it had.fix: i decided to try something after each use and i have gotten spectacular results.  after each use (used for in-ear monitors during rehearsals and shows), i wash them and then flip the large and middle flange up and leave it until the next use.  this resets the memory they tend to develop and even spreads the flange out a little more.  i get an even better seal after using this method than i did on the brand new pair!  they are lasting a long time now--four months and still sealing tight!\"], ['i am a musician and have been using high end ear buds with my wireless transmitter/receiver setup my band uses.  those were fitted with custom audiologist fitted hearing aid type ear inserts that were fitted to my earbuds.  i am a rock drummer and this is important stuff to preserve what is left of my hearing.  after years of regular use the earbud broke off inside the inserts.  i decided to try these units on my new shure earbuds.  they are sold by shure as an optional accessory to the little foam or rubber pieces that come with the earbuds to complement the fitting into the ear canal.  they work great and they are comfortable.  i wear hearing aids full time and am used to having things fitted into my ear canals.  the fitting is secure and they do not come out until i take them out.  just like the custom fitted ones but waaaaay cheaper.  i think they work just as good and save me lots os money.  win, win. yeaaah!'], [\"i've been using shure products for a few years and just love them.  these sleeves are a perfect fit, easy to apply, have a snug fit in the ear.  i live in a noisy area with block parties and bars.  these noise cancelling sleeves nearly block out all outside noise allowing me to enjoy my music and/or videos.  a great product.\"], ['these give a much better isolation from the room noise. i used them to set up a drum mix on a separate mixer and the drummer was about 8 feet away from me, i could clearly here what i was doing will setting up the mix. if you really want to tune the world out get these, they do the job.'], ['i use these when riding long distance on the motorcycle.  i hear my music loud and clear;

shaped more or less like teapots. they were too stiff, didn't conform to the ear canal, and they were so uncomfortable! they also lost a lot of the volume as the sounds escaped the ear, and were impossible to use without buds (even more uncomfortable).i noticed that these acoustibuds were one of the top-selling related products -- so i ordered a pair -- and now i see why. they fix all of those problems! three sizes, so you can pick the one that's most comfortable (per-ear; they say it's not uncommon to have two different sizes). soft and flexible, so they conform to your ear canal; this makes them more comfortable as well as louder. they are the perfect accessory for anything with these larger earbuds.full disclosure: i ordered my set of three from amazon, while simultaneously asking the seller (via email, at their official website) whether they were compatible with the avantree jogger pro. the seller sent me a free set of acoustibuds (the same three sizes as the amazon package) , asking if i tell them how compatible they were with the jogger pro. they didn't ask for an amazon review; they asked for it in email, and i sent them a response in email, but i am keeping both the paid-for set and the free set so i figure i should disclose that here.so, for anyone else out there wondering: yes, the acoustibuds work perfectly with the avantree jogger pro. acoustibuds should come with it! i highly recommend them for any products with those seemingly old-fashioned larger earbuds.\"], [\"i recently bought an ipod and couldn't get the earphones to stay in.  the shape

especially if you\\'ve had problems with sizing, comfort, outside noise, or having the earbuds fall out.  these \"acoustibuds\" will solve nearly any of these problems to a level you would be surprised at.  suddenly, bass sounds more bassy, and with a little eq tweak (say, to the rock setting), the highs come in very nicely, as well.the reason that some treble may be lost in my ear is because the medium size is slightly too large, and fits ok, but doesn\\'t fill my ear canal.  the small size is too small.  it\\'s also made out of silicone, which may dampen some higher ranges of frequencies.  but you can always try the different sizes out.  they are not difficult to attach, and will stay on nearly permanently, unless the silicone rubber wears out.  just don\\'t cover up the \\'ports\\' on the top of the earbud, or that will defeat the sound quality.i\\'m in love with the earbuds now as much as the ipod, practically (ok, i exaggerate a little, but these are the same earbuds i was going to replace as soon as i bought them, until i found this).  they now sound nearly as good as my old $100 sony headphones, and that is with the volume turned up only half way.  i kid you not!  and, the comfort level is so much higher than wearing earphones, because there is nothing squishing your earlobes for extended periods of time.  you can lay sideways and the sound isn\\'t greatly affected, if you like to doze off with your mp3 player.  and they are hard to beat sound quality wise without trying out many more earbuds or earphones than are worth being shipped.random hint: the black ones go well with the speck pixel case/ black (for the ipod touch); because they both look semi-industrial in nature.random hint #2: get this 3-pack with prime, if you have the

with that said, it does work and it does the job.  the volume through my ear canal is much improved and for that reason i won't return it.  however here are my comments on how this product or package

the same.  what it should be more close to is how shure or ultimate ears use a rubber mushroom shape which completely seals the ear canal.  all this does is have a bunch of flaps, but they flex too much to actually seal completely2)  i feel like i paid $14 bucks for one of 6 pieces in this set.  would be nice to pay $5 for just one pair or the like instead.  maybe i should resell the ones i

volume on his earpiece, that's how much they improve the sound level. also, he'd never had the jawbone fall out, not once. he wears a size 5, but now likes the 4 better.i couldn't wear them because my ear canal is very small (i am petite), even most small ear gels made by other manufacturers are too large for me, including those that came with my bose in-earphones & every bluetooth i ever tried

a time.i could force the size 5 into my ear and it would stay for a while and didn't hurt, but was simply too large, so they'd fall out.i wrote to the manufacturer asking if there was a smaller size available and they said that they had the 4 coming out and actually sent me a free trial pair, which was very nice. when we went out separate ways, my ex got custody of them, lol, because he liked how they fit him.at last, there is now the size 4 available for sale and i snapped them right up. i can now wear my bose earbuds in comfort and have tried them with hubby's jawbone and could wear it

additional covering over the earpiece - as has the shure - you need to remove that so the acoustibuds don't slip/slide around. once installed, you'll notice considerably improved sound quality from just about any earpiece set. even the oem ipod set sounds much better.as far as fit is concerned, i prefer the #4 - #5 will work, but #6 is simply too big. getting them into your ear requires a combination of wiggling as shown in instructions as well as twisting. once in, they won't fall out; you have to pull them out. helps to have clean ears and is a good idea to remove them from the earpieces every so often and clean using rubbing alcohol. once this is done, the acoustibuds are very dry. wetting them w/saliva does the trick, easing the process of getting them back into your ear.one caveat: do not use these and expect to hear anything but your player. they do such a good job of canceling out extraneous noise that, in some situations, they can be dangerous. for example,

shopped around on amazon, read the reviews and bought a less expensive, but highly rated media player. i was happy, except that it too, came with those type ear buds.  but with the money saved on the player i went in search of something that would work for my ears.  after lots of trial and error, i stumbled upon acoustibuds, they were a amazon gold box special, so for the price and the reviews (4 and 5 stars) figured it was worth the try.  plus, after experiencing a broken wire on a pair of over the ear phones that i actually did like, the idea that i could reuse these on a new pair of ear buds made them recyclable and appealed to me.  so i bought them, ascertained my size was a \"5\" and then popped them on my current ear buds.  i had to lower the volume by 40%, because the sound coming out of my inexpensive ear buds was now amazing, clear, wonderful!  the fit, awkward for about 2 minutes, soon became \"comfortable\" and i forgot they were there, except for this clear sound.

surprisingly loud environment.  the picture, with its highly suitable-for-purpose-looking rubber fins looked like they would go down into the ear canal, seal well, and block out ambient noise.  alas, every one of these assumptions was wrong!first, they do not go down onto the ear canal, partially because they are too short, and partially because the rubber lip that is used to attach them to the earphones increases the diameter of the earphone so much that they no longer fit in the ear well.second, the do not make a seal with the ear canal, so all of the purposeful-looking little fins might as well not be there.third, because of these two failings, they do not block out ambient noise much batter than the same earphones without these whatever-you-callums attached.curiously, they did make the medium to high range of the music to which i listened more distinct, but only when i was listening in a quiet environment.they are probably sturdily made, but i see no purpose in using them, so by that measure, it does not matter how well or poorly they are made, as they will last forever unused.also, taken just in light of what one receives in the package, $13.50 is an amazingly high price for

and it is ideal to use a new earpiece cover, so that skin oils won't cause slippage.  i don't know why the cone is angled; perhaps to keep it in the ear better.  if, one of the illustrations showed the buds separated from the earpiece, the acoustibud would be easier to understand.the bud works well, provides plenty of sound.  the material is soft rubber and appears quite durable.  you don't need

have odd ears, because most headphones don't stay in my ears for more than a moment. with these adapters (in size four), i could wear my headphones all day long. they keep the earbuds in my ears nice and snug - but without too much pressure like some other models - like those jvc marshmallow ones. i've tried those and they are extremely painful to wear.the bad:first of all - why the heck are they only available in packages with two or three sizes? the size 4 adapters work best for me, and the size 5 and 6 are a waste! i could save some money and order the two-pack, but it doesn't include size 4 !!!!  i'd be happy to order a three-pack if they were all in the size i needed.secondly - they don't stay attached to the headphones very well. the part of the adapter that slips over the earphone is not all that snug and they frequently fall off when not being worn in the ears. i am constantly digging through the tote bag or purse where i had stored them to find a fallen adapter or two. if i leave my headphones dangling from my mp3 player (as i often do if i have to leave my cubicle and head to another part of the office), they frequently fall off. i'm frequently seen looking under my desk with a flashlight for them - or retracing my steps around the office in search of them.i finally lost one of them when my car was totaled recently and it disappeared in the debris. i've been wearing one of the size 5 pieces since then, but it really doesn't fit well and sometimes it bothers my ear canal. i just pulled my earphones out of my bag today, and the other size 4 is gone. this really stinks! now i have to order three more pairs - just to get the one set i need and toss the other two sets. what a waste!for those who suggest cutting off the tips of the larger ones to make small ones - that won't work. it's not that the size 5 and 6 pieces are too long for my ear canals, it's that they are too wide. if i cut them off, i'd just have a shorter adapter that is too wide to be comfortable - and too short to stay in.the ugly:well ... just take a look at the picture. it's pretty self explanatory! lol i didn't take any points off my rating for this as it really can't be helped. it is what it is. :-)i would have given these a 4-star review if they hadn't had so much trouble with falling off the adapter, and i would have gone up to a 5-star if they also came in just the sizes that people wanted.\"], [\"this is definitely an individual thing, no two ears are alike.  had high hopes for these mainly to keep the apple earbuds in my ears.  the fit was ok but the longer i wore them, the more uncomfortable they became; good for about 20 minutes at a time.  the deal breaker was that they noticeably effected the sound quality, and not in a favorable way. obviously more bass as these create a sealed enclosure in your ear, but overall a hollow sound that can't be adjusted electronically.  the best solution is a neutral adapter that does not effect the original sound of your earbuds, unfortunately these don't fall into that category.  since the hole size on the acoustibuds is significantly different than the area of the earbud they can't even approach a neutral effect.i tried cutting off the end at about the halfway point which opens up the hole and eliminates the hollow sound.  they are not as secure after modifying them but stay in your ears better than earbuds alone. unfortunately they are still uncomfortable after about 20 minutes of use.this item must be tried to see if it will work for you when it comes to fit and comfort.  but

to bother with since my laptop only has 3 usb ports). then i searched again, expecting to find nothing, and noticed these. i may have found them before and ignored them due to the picture and name.after reading more into them, i ordered some. the other day i cleaned my laptop and used my new port covers. they work perfectly. considering i only paid $7 and was able to cover nearly ever port on my laptop, i can say i am very pleased.just to mention, my laptop is a sony vaio. there are a few ports that remained uncovered, but they don't really need covers as much. the only 3 without covers are the phone connection port (since i have dial up, this is usually in use), a small one by my hdmi that i think may be a micro usb, and one above the sd for another type of memory card, but that seems to have a flap to block dust from entering. a cover even went unused on my laptop (the one that looked like a usb cover, only longer).so far, only the sd cover has fallen off. but that is because of my laptop and not the covers (sd slot is on the curve so port cover can't fully fit into it like rest). while writing this, i went around and tried to take off a couple of the covers. it isn't the easiest thing to do, but i can get them off without too much effort using only my hands. i haven't tried to travel with them, but i don't expect any to fall off during travel. they fit in snugly, but not so much that i am worried about them getting stuck.in summary, these are well worth the money if you want to keep dust out of your laptop ports. if i ever need more laptop covers in the future, i would get another set of these (or try their desktop covers if i get a desktop). i also would recommend them to friends who are looking for covers. also, the cord wrap is a nice little bonus that i actually had a use for.\"], [\"this is a complete set for a standard laptop with four usb ports, vga, hdmi, ethernet (lan), sd card reader, and headphone+microphone jacks. it also has an esata port cover for models that have one. it would be nice to even have a power jack cover but i'd assume it would always be removed from time to time.on my particular laptop though (clevo w110er), the vga cover occasionally detaches itself, especially when i place it in a laptop or bag sleeve with the port facing downward. this is easily resolved by putting a pinch of blu-tack inside the dust cover before attaching it to the port.only the ethernet dust cover is completely flush with the laptop body. the others protrude and have a small protrusion themselves (sort of a tiny nipple) to aid in pulling out the cover, as they sit pretty tight (except for the vga).this is a great purchase, complemented well by a keyboard cover, to keep dust out and preserve the resale value of the

the sound was better.if style is the primary purpose for buying earbuds, these win a million times over. they simply look way cooler than anything in ear i've ever seen. the white ceramic body has a deep pearl gloss that is indescribable. the white silicone inserts and white cloth covered wires finish off an amazing look. they are super light weight; they really weigh next to nothing. if these were jewelry, they would be a steal.for me, style is a factor; i don't want to put something hideous in my ears. but that isn't the primary reason i buy in ear monitors, it is for sound first and foremost. these are better than the junk apple includes with all those idevices. but they are just a little bit better. the bass is muddy and not very strong. midrange is decent, so vocals are there and clear. they are tuned way to the highs, and that is a bit overpowering. i take my listening very seriously and found the sound to be a bit tiring over time.the other problem i had with these ear buds was fit of the silicone inserts. the headphones come with three different sizes of inserts. none of them fit right in my ear. i just couldn't get a good fit or seal. i have worn around 30 different brands and styles of in ear monitors and have never had this much trouble with fit.my frame of reference for headphones is very wide, from the similarly priced jlab to five times the price bowers & wilkins and all kinds of headphones in between. i run a lot of different music genres through the headphones when i try them.the cord is very nice. the wire is covered in a very fine white fabric that does not transmit noised up to the headphones. most headphones with plastic insulation will create all kind of noises in the headphones when ever i move, not these.these are inexpensive headphones. they are an upgrade from the ear buds included with most devices. they are truly beautiful and do stay in my ear. sound is just not what i am used to.the manufacturer provided me with a pair of these headphones for review.although not as pretty xeport does have a pair of much better sounding headphones for not much more money:xeport 5010-8 superbass hifi noise isolating earphones (with a free carrying case) - on sales now\"], ['these days i listen to music on my iphone primarily in the gym while exercising, and for those purposes the bluetooth wireless headphones are mostly adequate. however, almost all of those headphones have very subprime sound quality, to say the least. the standard iphone headphones are not much better, but they are usually the ones that i reach for when listening to music in other situations. unfortunately, as a consequence of these choices of headphones i\\'ve been inadvertently forced to settle for a rather inferior music-listening experience. so when i came across xeport\\'s headphones, i had felt that my ears had been opened. i\\'ve used high-quality headphones in the past, and in terms of sound quality the xeport headphones are definitely on par with many of those.***** the sound quality *****the sound quality is definitely one of the biggest selling points of these headphones. they make a crisp, loud and well-formed sound. when listening to classical piano works i can hear each note reverberating clearly and distinctly from the others. the high notes don\\'t have the \"tinny\" sound that i\\'ve been accustomed to from many lower-end headphones. the lower notes are rich and warm, but the bass leaves something to be desired.. the high fidelity of sound is particularly noticeable when listening to the older recordings - all the subtle \"noise\" of such recordings comes clearly through.  the overall sound quality is not quite as good as the one of the xeport 5010-8 model, but it is definitely above most low-end headphones.i particularly liked using these headphones with dance/electronic music. they can really push the beat through.***** noise canceling *****these headphones don\\'t have the active noise-canceling capabilities, but their passive noise suppression was more than adequate for most of my purposes. this is particularly the case when listening to music somewhat loudly - all the surrounding sounds were completely blocked, and hardly any of the headphones\\' own sound leaked out.***** accessories *****in addition to the actual headphones, the packaging includes three sets of silicone single flange tips. the tips ought to fit most ear sizes. they are comfortable and easy to replace.***** look and feel *****these headphones look pretty elegant and fashionable. i am not too thrilled with the woven nylon cable, but it too has certain charm and can be a fashion statement in its own right. the white ceramic unibody look is very pretty, and it comes closes to the \"replacement\" look for the apple\\'s signature in-ear headphones. so if you\\'d like to stick to that particular visual aesthetic, then thee headphones will be a perfect choice for you. i would have liked to have some playback/volume controls placed on the headphones themselves, but this is not a deciding feature for me. the headphones are very light and they fit smoothly and unobtrusively into your ears. even after a few hours of listening to the music on them they did not become uncomfortable. oftentimes i have a slight pain in my ears after wearing some other in-ear headphones, but so far i have not had any such experience with xeport 7010-0.***** conclusion *****these are really very good headphones and they will make any music lover pretty happy. they are solidly built, have a good sound quality, and an unbeatably low price. highly recommended.'], ['i was offered a set of these earphones to review by the manufacturer. i listen to music and audio books all the time so i gave them a try.these are the high end version of the earplugs they offer and i was astounded at the sound quality out of these ear buds. these earplugs have very good bass and midrange but they stay separated where the bass does not overwhelm the midrange. bass just really is sweet and you can hear every beat and tone the way it was meant to be.the high end of the sound spectrum is still crisp and clear. they were in line with the listening enjoyment i experienced with the 5010-8 model also from xeport.  separation of voice and instruments is spectacular and provides a very enjoyable listening experience.  i played a variety of music to cover the full spectrum of frequencies and tones and i was not disappointed by the performance at all.the earplugs also come with three sets of different sized gel ear plugs so you can pick the right size for your ear. this is critical to select properly and the right fit dramatically improves the listening experience you will have. choosing the right size reduces the amount of ambient noise that you will hear while wearing these earplugs. in addition the comfort level is really good to the point that you will forget you are wearing them at all. with the right size earplug in place you will have a very good acoustic coupling and direct most of the sound energy produced into your ear and not allow it to be diverted outward and thus lose the dynamics of the music. it has a lot to do with the quality of the audio experience you will have listening to your music. while they will not perfectly block out ambient noise you will have to be careful as you will not hear a car coming for example while walking.the earplugs are very lightweight and come with a long cable.  i am not crazy about the white nylon sleeved cables.  i wonder about people who would exercise in them and get them dirty or sweaty.  it is just a perception that i have and it is not based on experience.  they are professionally made and they look very nice.  the cables are strong and have good strain reliefs at each end. i did not deduct any stars for the nylon braided sleeves as they are attractive and the concern just maybe my own personal bias.the earplugs come with a very nice nylon carrying case that is rigid like a piece of carryon luggage. it is shaped nicely to fit into your pocket or purse and zips shut. it has a soft inner liner and a net that would actually let you carry two sets of earplugs in the same case. the case is very well made and it is a nice enhancement to the product and provides a safe way to carry the earplugs with you at all times.these earplugs are an excellent buy and provide superior quality sound with other nice features:* selectable ear gel sizes for comfort and sound quality.* nice strain relief on the earplug for long life of the wiring.* lightweight and yet strongly manufactured* very nice carrying case for pocket or purse.* superior sound performance and listening pleasure* priced every competitivelythese sound great listening to any type of music. i recommend these earplugs as a very good buy and they offer great performance. you will enjoy them!'], ['packaging and accessories: the 7010s come in a simple box with a plastic front window and ship with three pairs of silicone single flange tips and...that\\'s it. retail models apparently ship with a clamshell case but my review sample didn\\'t come with one.design and build quality: ceramic housings identical to those of the meelectronics cc51 inspire confidence but i\\'m not really pleased with the fabric covered cable but that\\'s more a personal preference than a legitimate gripe. the cable is well relieved at both ends. tiny bit of driver flex.comfort and isolation: fairly comfortable with the smallest single flange tips in my ears but did feel a bit tight, but that\\'s again, more of a personal issue than a universal problem. your mileage may vary, of course. the 7010 isolates about as well as any other typical dynamic driver iem, which is about average overall. microphonics are present when wearing the iems straight down due to the fabric cable but are less of an issue when they are worn over the ear.sound qualitybombastic bass is the name of the game here and believe me when i say that it\\'s big. the low end is dominated by big, boomy and occasionally rather sloppy mid-bass which isn\\'t as detailed or rumbly as it is bold and in your face. strangely enough, despite the fact that the 5010s are touted as the earphones for bass lovers, with its variable bass tuning, the 7010s are nearly neck and neck with them, only losing out in sub bass extension.because of the big bass and sizable mid-bass hump, the midrange is occluded a fair amount. the detail is pretty good for an earphone in this price range but one would need to eq the mid-bass down a few decibels to get the most of it. i noticed a tiny dip in the frequency response at about 2 khz or so, which only the most discerning listeners should notice so it shouldn\\'t be a big deal.the high end is mostly laid back in presentation with good detail but lacks airiness and sparkle that i\\'m used to in similarly priced earphones. but that isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing, as the relative lack of shimmer or sparkle makes these a very easy and non-fatiguing listen.now, i can\\'t speak for anyone other than myself but what i needed when listening to these was time for my brain to \"burn in\" and adjust to the sound signature each and every time i listened to them. the obnoxious bass seems to calm down and settle into its natural role and the detail in the other frequencies becomes more apparent. but this is only going to apply to people who enjoy this kind of sound signature. if you don\\'t like your bass on the big side, you\\'re not going to like these. period. but if you do, like i do, you\\'ll probably find these to be quite enjoyable.'], ['xeport goal is to offer good quality earphones at a reasonable price. with

on 8 out of 10 blind tries i was able to correctly identify the xeport when compared to a set of earphones that sell for about 4 times as much.before enumerating the good-to-outstanding features, let me note the not so good ones:- does not treat the low bass notes as well as the high end competition does.- higher pitch notes sound good but they\\'re not as brilliant as what the more expensive earphones produce.- cord is covered with \\'plastic\\'. i happen to prefer \\'braided\\' but that\\'s a matter of personal preference. the other xeport models come with braided cords.- no controls.

cable is rubbery, unlike those of its siblings and is, in my opinion at least, much better. the only worry i have is for the short and stubby strain relief at the 3.5mm jack but shouldn\\'t be an issue for those who take care of these. some driver flex.comfort and isolation: the long nozzles facilitate deeper insertion depths and the small single flange tips were comfortable in my tests. these are almost impossible to wear over the ear because of the long strain reliefs but microphonics and cable noise aren\\'t much of an issue, regardless. isolation was average for a vented dynamic driver iem.sound qualitythis may well be the best of the bunch. similar to the meelectronics sp51 and hippo vb that came before it, the xeport 5010 incorporates a variable bass tuning system into its nearly identical housings. the 5010 comes with three sets of interchangeable tuning plates which screw on to the rear of the housings. like the sp51, the bass plates are silver, gunmetal and black, offering incremental increases in bass. my listening impressions have been done using the gunmetal plate.the bass is unsurprisingly a strength of these earphones and not purely because you can control how much of it you get. no matter which plate is in place, the bass is well controlled, punchy and has nice texture and definition. extension is rather impressive as well and is nicely balanced with no obnoxious mid-bass hump to worry about.the midrange is (mostly) free of bass bleed and is smooth but not lacking in detail. warm, is the word i\\'d use to describe it but not so warm that the resolution is hurt but these aren\\'t the kind of iems you\\'ll go to for micro-detail retrieval. there\\'s a bit of grain throughout the midrange as well but nothing too detrimental to the sound quality overall. i know this comment sounds rather bad but when put into perspective of its price point, it\\'s not bad at all and i can say that these can easily punch above their $20 price.treble is, once again, fairly laid back and even handed in its presentation. it never gets to the point of sibilance because it lacks that extra bit of sparkle and clarity of iems such as the re0, but, again, for something that costs as little as these do, that\\'s to be expected.the soundstage created by the 5010 is actualy surprisingly deep, giving these an \"out of the head\" sound. imaging is rather nice as well and i was pretty satisfied with the width and height of the stage as well.'], ['xeport goal is to offer good quality earphones at a reasonable price. as far as quality and performance, the 3010-2 lies somewhere in between xeport\\'s excellentxeport 5010-8 superbass hifi noise isolating earphones (with a free carrying case)and the not so impressive but prettyxeport 7010-0 ceramic hifi noise isolating earphones (with a free carrying case). at the time i\\'m writing this review the 3010-2 sells for a few dollars less than the other 2 models but i find it hard to justify buying something that\\'s not the prettiest or be best sounding of the bunch.before enumerating the good-to-outstanding features, let me note the so-so ones:- bass is not as good as the 5010-8, maybe \\'good\\' when compared with other makers\\' earphones selling for about the same price.- higher pitch notes sound good but, again, not as good as the 5010-8.- design and general looks don\\'t even attempt to suggest \\'high end\\'. maybe they should get a good mark for honesty :)- no controls. some earphones in this price range come with on-cord controls for volume and some have them for pause/stop/skip. xeport relies entirely on your player. not a huge deal but worth noting.now, here are the good parts:+ pretty good noise isolation because they go deep down your ear canal. it\\'s not \\'noise cancellation\\' but the good fit successfully muffles everything else.+ eartips in 3 sizes.+ comfortable to wear. very little discomfort after wearing them for over one hour.+ braided cord, a feature that i personally favor.+ comes with a case. xeport\\'s zippered hard, round case should keep earphones safe while not in use and adds significant value given that many earphones in this price range or even higher end come with no case or a soft pouch.my 3 stars (it\\'s okay) mean that you aren\\'t necessarily doing something wrong if buying one of these. you do save some money over the better xeport 5010-8 but i\\'d personally go with the better model.___________________________________________note:i\\'d like to disclose that i didn\\'t actually buy these earphones myself. xeport offered to send me some of their products for review and i accepted their offer. it\\'s possible that reviewing a free product affected my objectivity but i hope that it didn\\'t. when granting three stars to this product i asked myself: \"knowing what i know now, would i be buying this product if i wanted a not-so-high-end but good quality pair of earphones?\" and the answer was \\'maybe not\\' because there are better options out there.'], [\"besides great clarity and deep sounds mentioned in some of the other reviews, i'd like to note that these are bewilderingly durable.  i have a pair of 5010's for at home, and i use a pair of these 3010-2's at my workplace.to my own fault, i am constantly getting them caught on stuff or forgetting i have them in (they are extremely comfortable) and attached to the computer.  every time i carelessly rip them out of the audio jack, i cringe and gingerly plug them back in and listen to hear if i've caused them significant damage... nothing!i've had many other similar sets that have been destroyed by far less torture... but these just keep on going!if they do eventually break under my abuse, i'm comforted by the fact that i can get a replacement pair for this cheap.  this is a top-notch product... i'm very happy and would recommend xeport in a heartbeat.\"], [\"these xeport 3010-2 earphones are perhaps the most comfortable earphones i have ever used, to the point that i have worn them to sleep every night for the past two weeks and have experienced no issues at all. i was thrilled to be offered a set these by the manufacturer to review. but that in no way influences my review or rating. here are my observations:pros -+ comfort; as noted above, these are very comfortable and fit deeply in the ear+ noise isolation; these block out all but the loudest of outside soundsmisc -- while i'm not an audiophile, these are reasonably good for the classic rock and classical music i enjoythe comfort and noise isolation of these earphones makes these perfect night time earphones. also take a look atxeport 5010-8 superbass hifi noise isolating earphones (with a free carrying case) - on sales nowfor a reasonably priced but excellent sounding pair of earphones.recommended!cfh\"], [\"the xeport 3010-2 in ear monitors are a good set of headphones for the price. they are light weight with a compact design. i could easily fall asleep with these in my ears.at this price point, these have surprisingly good sound. they are well built and look good. i found the bass thin. these are accurate headphones with smooth response from bass to treble; the bass just doesn't go deep enough, like the frequency response is rolled off. i also had a very hard time finding a silicone ear tip that fit my ears. this is something i never have a problem with; i've tried around 30 pairs of in ear monitors and have always been able to get a good solid fit. a poor fit may be the reason i don't hear a lot of bass. they were also a bit of a problem in airplanes, leaking a bit more plane noise than i normally like (granted i was also in a regional jet with more than the usual amount of noise).i found the soundstage closed, mostly within my head, and no sense of spaciousness. imaging was not very precise. but i didn't expect audiophile quality at this price. my reference headphones are bowers & wilkins c5 and shure e3c, both cost about five times as much as these.the wires are covered in a nice smooth black fabric. they tend to tangle a bit less than plastic coated wires. they also don't transmit as much noise up to the headphone while moving around. the silicone tips don't fit as tightly on the headphone as i'd like. the tips should be very hard to remove so there is no chance they could ever fall off in your ear. the fit on these is snug, but not super tight.of the three in ear monitors xeport offers, these are in the middle of the pack. they aren't nearly as pretty as the white ceramic models, but they do sound better. i like the style of these over the slightly more expensive xeport 5010-8 gray models.for around $20 these are a bargain. the sound is good, although without a lot of low end. i had trouble getting a good fit, but that could just be my ears.the manufacturer provided me with a pair of these for review.\"], ['these days i listen to music on my iphone primarily in the gym while exercising, and for those purposes the bluetooth wireless headphones are mostly adequate. however, almost all of those headphones have very subprime sound quality, to say the least. the standard iphone headphones are not much better, but they are usually the ones that i reach for when listening to music in other situations. unfortunately, as a consequence of these choices of headphones i\\'ve been inadvertently forced to settle for a rather inferior music-listening experience. so when i came across xeport\\'s headphones, i had felt that my ears had been opened. i\\'ve used high-quality headphones in the past, and in terms of sound quality the xeport headphones are definitely on par with many of those.***** the sound quality *****the sound quality is definitely one of the biggest selling points of these headphones. they make a crisp, loud and well-formed sound. when listening to classical piano works i can hear each note reverberating clearly and distinctly from the others. the high notes don\\'t have the \"tinny\" sound that i\\'ve been accustomed to from many lower-end headphones. the lower notes are rich and warm, and the headphones can handle the bass sounds as well as any in this category that i\\'ve tried. the high fidelity of sound is particularly noticeable when listening to the older recordings - all the subtle \"noise\" of such recordings comes clearly through. the overall sound quality is not quite as good as the one of the xeport 5010-8 model, but it is definitely above most low-end headphones.i particularly liked using these headphones with dance/electronic music. they can really push the beat through.***** noise canceling *****these headphones don\\'t have the active noise-canceling capabilities, but their passive noise suppression was more than adequate for most of my purposes. this is particularly the case when listening to music somewhat loudly - all the surrounding sounds were completely blocked, and hardly any of the headphones\\' own sound leaked out.***** accessories *****in addition to the actual headphones, the packaging includes three sets of silicone single flange tips. the tips ought to fit most ear sizes. they are comfortable and easy to replace.***** look and feel *****these headphones look pretty elegant and fashionable. i am not too thrilled with the woven nylon cable, but it too has certain charm and can be a fashion statement in its own right. i would have liked to have some playback/volume controls placed on the headphones themselves, but this is not a deciding feature for me. the headphones are very light and they fit smoothly and unobtrusively into your ears. even after a few hours of listening to the music on them they did not become uncomfortable. oftentimes i have a slight pain in my ears after wearing some other in-ear headphones, but so far i have not had any such experience with xeport 3010-2.***** conclusion *****these are really impressive headphones and they will make any audiophile more than happy. they are solidly built, have an impressive sound quality, and an unbeatably low price. highly recommended.'], [\"these earphones are the low end of xeport's product line but to be honest they are almost every bit as good in all aspects as the high end models they sell.  the sound quality is outstanding with good bass that does not walk on the midrange.  the high end sounds are still crystal clear and the overall production of the sound is so good you will enjoy your music at a new high quality level.the earplugs also come with three sets of different sized gel ear plugs so you can pick the right size for your ear. this is critical to select properly and the right fit dramatically improves the listening experience you will have. choosing the right size reduces the amount of ambient noise that you will hear while wearing these earplugs. in addition the comfort level is really good to the point that you will forget you are wearing them at all. with the right size earplug in place you will have a very good acoustic coupling and direct most of the sound energy produced into your ear and not allow it to be diverted outward and thus lose the dynamics of the music. it has a lot to do with the quality of the audio experience you will have listening to your music. while they will not perfectly block out ambient noise you will have to be careful as you will not hear a car coming for example while walking.the earplugs are very lightweight and come with a long cable.  i am not crazy about the black nylon sleeved cables but they are professionally made and they look very nice.  the cables are strong and have good strain reliefs at each end. i did not deduct any stars for the nylon braided sleeves as they are attractive but are simply different than what i have owned in the past.the earplugs come with a very nice nylon carrying case that is rigid like a piece of carryon luggage. it is shaped nicely to fit into your pocket or purse and zips shut. it has a soft inner liner and a net that would actually let you carry two sets of earplugs in the same case. the case is very well made and it is a nice enhancement to the product and provides a safe way to carry the earplugs with you at all times.these earplugs are a steal for the price.  they offer a high end listening experience with a carrying case that would cost 8 to 10 dollars and they sell the earplugs and the case for $19.95 with the case included.  they are well worth the money and you will enjoy them.i was provided a set of these earplugs to test for this review by the manufacturer.\"], [\"packaging and accessories: the 3010s come in a simple box with a plastic front window and ship with three pairs of silicone single flange tips and...that's it.design and build quality: entirely metal in design with a sizable vent along the top, short stubby strain reliefs at both ends and a fabric covered cable. feels solid but i personally don't love the cloth covered cable. some driver flex.comfort and isolation: the thin housings feature long, thin nozzles and work well for shallow or deep insertion depths. isolation is about average due to the vent. microphonics are present but can be nearly mitigated by wearing these over the ear.sound qualitythese surprised me the most of the three. though not quite as technically capable as the 5010 or 7010, they're not far off at all. the sound signature is warm, bass driven and surprisingly open. being the cheapest of the lot, i was shocked at just how good these things sounded. the low end is on the north side of neutral and caries a good amount of detail and punch that should satisfy fans of rap/hip-hop and edm.the midrange isn't occluded by the low end and is, again, impressively detailed for a pair of iems this cheap. staying in line with its siblings, the midrange isn't the star of the show but its warmth and smoothness makes it versatile and inoffensive. there was never a point listening to these where the midrange disappointed me. of course, it can't compete with the detail retrieval of much more expensive iems like the a151 and re0 but for $10, it's not supposed to either.high end detail and presentation doesn't lag behind the midrange and is similarly laid back like that of the 7010 and 5010, but carries enough detail to shine. the presentation of these iems is slightly v-shaped but not in a way that creates an excessive amount of sibilance (although there is some).the soundstage and imaging are average in performance and the presentation is decent overall.\"], [\"i was getting new ear buds and am tired of my other sets getting tangled at the bottom of my computer bag, running the risk of damage.  you could probably get two sets in this

to flopping around.\"], [\"out of the box i couldn't use my earpods, the fall out of my ears just sitting still. with the addition of hue he burton acoustibuds for earpods - they are now my go-to

similarly, how does the volume compare using the earpods with and without the acoustibuds?  sound volume was increased because less sound was leaking away from my ear canal.feel - how do the earpods feel with the epb-black acoustibuds compared to using the earphones without them? the earpods do actually stay in your ear better than apples previous ear buds, but the acoustibud adapter improves the fit and snugness.installation - are the epb-black tips easy to install on your earphones and in your ears?  it was pretty easy to install and put in my ears.  i had to make sure the speaker opening wasn't obstructed by the plastic, but that wasn't an issue.fit on bud - do the epb-black tips stay on the earpod earbud well?  yes they do.\"], [\"based on the very positive reviews, i bought these tips for a set of earbuds for an iphone 5. after trying them out, i returned them. this is why:first, the design of the tips is quite flawed. they slip over the anterior portion of the bud, but in so doing, they completely cover the bass port of the buds. when i inserted the covered earpods, the sound was badly muffled, and none of the basic clarity of the earpods came through. the earpods are hardly audiophile quality to begin with, but after putting on these covers, and then removing them, the sound of the earpods almost sounded as if they were.second,  the covers conceal the left and right markers on the earbuds, so you're playing a guessing game as to which side goes where.third, the sizing is inconsistent. on the left side, the tip offered a tight seal against my ear canal. on the right side, the tip wouldn't stay in place at all. it kept falling out, and as far as i know, my ears are of relatively equal dimension.finally, the build quality, aside from the inconsistent fit, is pretty weak. these covers are cheap, thin, and will tear, unless you tear them off first, which will most likely be the case. and, they're ugly as well.\"], [\"this is a great product i'm usually very skeptical when it comes to these types of products but this product is very simple and very very good at keeping the apple earbuds in your ears. i usually wear my earbuds most of the day as i

i'm using the acoustibuds. this is a great product thank you!!\"], ['i tried these on my apple ear pods. they fit in the ear snugly. butt the sound suffers. they increase the bass but muffle the clarity. not that great for listening to music. i recommend the earskinz es2 ear pod covers. much, much better product!'], [\"profound improvement of the bass.  gives the apple earpods the low end they are otherwise missing.  a little too heavy for me but i'm in a distinct minority regarding my preference for modest bass.  i think most people will find the result perfect.  the rest of the earpod's spectral response is already pretty good and these preserve that.  i found that breaking the ear canal seal just a bit moderates that bass into a range more comfortable for me.they are a bit difficult to get on the buds but you won't be taking them off again and the tight fit makes for a good seal and security.  they won't be coming off by themselves.the ear canal fit is plenty comfortable and will make the earpods very suitable for exercise and running.these transform the earpods from passable to quite good.  they might even move the earpod knockoff clones from awful to passable.\"], [\"i must have odd shaped ears because i always have problems keeping ear buds in my ears.  when i purchased apple's new earbuds i still had the same problem and tossed them into a
